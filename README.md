# Chatter App

This is a flutter based modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat with their friends, family, colleagues among groups with enriched User-Experience.

It uses Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package which equips this app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

One of the first simple apps I created while on my journey to learn flutter.
